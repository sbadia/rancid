# LG_IMAGE	is the filename of an image you wish to appear at the top
#		of the LG pages.  it can also be other html goo, like
#		the first example.  this is just handed to print, so \n and
#		the like will work.

#
# LG_ROUTERDB	is the router.db in rancid's router.db format, listing
#		the routers and their platform that should be available to
#		the looking glass.  if defined, the LG will use this variable
#		to find the router.db.  if not defined, it will look for it
#		at <prefix>/util/lg/router.db.  if it does not exist, it will
#		build the list from <prefix>/*/router.db (ie: the router.db's
#		from all your groups).  note that if you choose this last
#		option; the group directories and router.db files' modes may
#		have to be changed, depending upon the UID/GID of the user
#		your server (httpd) runs under, since rancid's default mask
#		is 007 (see bin/env).  routers marked 'down' are skipped.

#$LG_ROUTERDB="@prefix@/util/lg/router.db";
#
#
# LG_CLOGINRC	is the .cloginrc that the LG should use.  it defaults to
#		<prefix>/.cloginrc.  note that the .cloginrc must readable
#		by the user or group (UID / GID) that will be running the CGI
#		and the clogin (and friends) will not allow a world readable
#		.cloginrc.  this is normally the user the server (httpd) runs
#		under.

#
# LG_CACHE_DIR	is the location of the cache directory.  the LG uses this
#		to hold lock files, lg.log log file, and o/p from commands
#		that can be very verbose.  it defaults to "tmp", ie: relative
#		to the directory where lg.cgi runs in your server's (httpd's)
#		DocumentRoot (eg: /usr/local/www/data/lg/tmp).
#
#$LG_CACHE_DIR="./tmp";
#
#
# LG_CACHE_TIME	is the number of seconds the LG should cache o/p from certain
#		commands; those that tend to produce a lot of o/p, such as
#		'show ip bgp dampened-paths'.  it defaults to 600 seconds
#		(10 minutes).
#
#$LG_CACHE_TIME=600;
#
#
# LG_LOG	is either a FQPN (fully qualified path name) the syslog
#		facility to use for logging.  if not defined, the LG
#		will log to LG_CACHE_DIR/lg.log.  possible syslog facility
#		values are from the facility codes in /usr/include/syslog.h
#		minus the 'LOG_' and lower case.
