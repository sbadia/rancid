	.cloginrc as they are with every other .cloginrc directive.

	f10rancid: Fix to pick up new info in show version output.

	jrancid: Ignore Timecounter "TSC" in show system boot-messages output.

	rancid: filter tty line speed when configured for auto-configure

	flogin: bring login() and do_enable() in-line with [cj]login.  also
	match "telnet server disabled" - from brad volz.

	control_rancid: report devices added to router.db - from Fredrik Thulin
	also eliminate empty up/down lists.

	rancid/jrancid: filter isis passwords - partial from Janos Mohacsi

	lg: make o/p from the lg stream (unbuffered), so one doesnt have
	to wait for entire o/p from the router in a failing traceroute, for
	example.  suggestion and clues from alexander koch.  while here, fix
	cache handling so 1) it doesnt cache cmds that resulted in an error or
	otherwise failed and 2) log and run the cmd as normal if there are
	problems opening a cache file.

	lg: make logging more consistent.  log as defined by LG_LOG if
	possible and stderr as last resort.  it was logging largely to stderr.
	and make exit-code small (instead of 255); some wait()s only look at
	the first 3 bits

	lg: add check in lg.cgi that router name appears in the router.db
	and is thus accessible.  from richard doty.  also fix-up a few
	comments and such.

	hang.

	add device name to diff mail subject when -r is specified

	add -m <mail rcpt> option to do-diffs and control_rancid to allow
	specific mail recipient.  intended for use with -r to trigger diffs

	(cisco can't always spell - thanks to Terry Kennedy for
	spotting the misspelling).

	lg: filter ["`'] from args

	rancid: fix username secret filtering

	alogin: misplaced brace caused improper return from proc login

	relax the check ping and traceroute check of hostname arguments such

	add merit MRTd support

	add -r <device> option to do-diffs and control_rancid

	brancid: handle []'s in bay prompts and drop lock-address from config

	can be used within configuration mode.  note: this turns $prompt into
	a regexp, WRT -s scripts and -re option for expect's.

	add -Evar=x option to pass variables to scripts.  eg:
		clogin -Evariable=something router...
		clogin -Evariable=a,b,c [ie: an array/list which user splits]

	fix jlogin's password/userpassword functionality which broke when
	cmd-line options were made consistent.

	add check for config/* files missing from the cvs repository.

	match to find login errors and avoid such matches in router o/p.

	Change default umask to 027 (it was 007) mainly as an

	group's collection.

	configure now has a --enable-mail-plus option to have rancid
	send mail to rancid+$GROUP instead of to rancd-$GROUP.

	thing as if you'd specified ;-separated commands with -c (newline
	separates commands).  thanks to stephen stuart.

	- does a subst on commands in run_commands so that expansion of
	escapes is performed; e.g. you can say "copy rcp://blah slot0:\r" to
	answer the question that comes after the copy command.
