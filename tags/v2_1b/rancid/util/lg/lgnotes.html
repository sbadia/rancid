<ul>
Just a few straight forward notes on our implementation of
Ed Kern's looking glass.  See the "real thing" at
<a href=http://nitrous.digex.net>http://nitrous.digex.net</a>.
</ul>
</p>

<UL>
<li>Items in the queries column which do not have radio buttons
    are not yet implemented but are on the list of things to do.</li>
<li>Some items are not implemented for the junipers yet (so, as i get
    to it) or no equivalent exists.
<li>If there is something which you feel is missing, feel free to ask
    and/or send comments to the <a href=mailto:rancid@shrubbery.net>maintainer
    </a> to implement it.  No guarantees.</li>
<li>Only one query per router allowed at any given time.  This is to avoid
    resource deprivation.  The looking glass will attempt to serialize
    queries.</li>
<li>The looking glass will ping a router prior to querying it to avoid
    trying to query routers which are down or otherwise inaccessible.</li>
<li>Login failures can be intermittent or permanent, either due to the
    router being inaccessible from the looking glass machine, 
    or authorization failure(s).  Contact your local network engineering
    folks to resolve login failures.</li>
<li>Queries followed by &lt;something&gt; require an argument(s) in the text
    window below the query list.  Some queries take optional arguments
    denoted by [something].  Multiple arguments should be separated by a
    space.</li>
<li>Note that output from certain queries is cached by the server and may
    be slightly out of date.  These queries will be noted as such in the
    output.  This is limited to queries which could produce lots of output,
    such as 'sh ip bgp dampened-paths'.</li>
<li>Note that some queries have potential to produce great load on the router
    and produce lots of output, such as 'sh ip bgp' or 'sh ip bgp reg '^3561'.
    The looking glass attempts to deny such commands.</li>
