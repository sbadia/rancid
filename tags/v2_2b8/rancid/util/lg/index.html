   this is just a redirection page to load lg.cgi - is there a way to
   make the server load a .cgi as it's default document?
   this can also be done with a redirect (which is supposedly more universally
   supported.  something like <redirect URL=lgform.cgi>.  not sure...i'm not
   a web person.  but this works for netscape.
