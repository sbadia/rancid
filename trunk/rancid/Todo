- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- add .cloginrc var to say to use ssh or telnet
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
- Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- change rancid to work on a file
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
