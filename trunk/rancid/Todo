- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- better error loggin in the looking glass
- why do 'make distclean' & 'make dist' fail on fbsd 3.3?
- handle foundry and reback in the looking glass
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin into one.  possible?
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
- Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- check clogin.  does it handle multiple addrs for 1 fqdn correctly?

- do-diffs (or something in the proc path) should make sure that all
  the CVS'd files are up to date with respect to the repository.
- missing man pages for lg.conf.5 ??, rtrfilter.1 ??, lgform.cgi.1 ???,
  lg.cgi.1 ???
- control_rancid should trap to 'rm -f routerS.db, routers*.new', 
- control_rancid needs to check for existence of these files:
	wc: routers.all: No such file or directory
	[: 97: unexpected operator
	comm: /tftpboot/rancid/foo/routers.up: No such file or directory
