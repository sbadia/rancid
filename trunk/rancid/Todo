- better error loggin in the looking glass
- why do 'make distclean' & 'make dist' fail on fbsd 3.3?
- handle foundry and reback in the looking glass
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- need to strip community strings from foundry, redback
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin into one.  possible?
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
- Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- check clogin.  does it handle multiple addrs for 1 fqdn correctly?
