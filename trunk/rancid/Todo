- would like to have a "timeout" cloginrc directive
- rancid needs to filter hsrp keys.  as in
  interface FastEthernet0/1 
   ip address 158.81.248.252 255.255.255.128
   standby 1 ip 158.81.248.254
   standby 1 authentication donkey2k
   standby 2 ip 158.81.248.249
   standby 2 authentication donkey2k
- rancid needs to filter this key.  what is it anyway?  seen on
  r00.atlnga03.us.sa
    key chain jitz 
     key 1
  -   key-string 7 130618140D0901
  +   key-string 7 130618140D0901
- on 6500, show boot and show bootvar produce the same output and both appear
  in the crunched config.  should one be filtered?
- fix varargs for knf in util.c
- isis filtering for foundry?
- extreme v6.2.x need 'show configuration detail' to get full config but
  does not work on older vers
- hlogin hangs when the procurve does not ask for passwords
- util/ tool to prune cvs versions, excluding those with tags, by (all but
  latest | keep N versions | keep N days/months/years)
- extreme collections lose when the config on the switch is in an unsaved
  state, probably due to the prompt changing or rather how clogin formulates
  the prompt used by expect{ -re }'s.
- extreme collection fails for tacacs-enabled boxen due to diffs in UI - blech!
- FILTER_PWDS knob is not implemented in alteon, bay, ezt3 or redback due to
  lack of h/w to test against.  need help from the community.
- should par's -c override an input files' : cmd?
- should *login emmit "clogin error:" or "*login error:" to make matches for
  login failures definitive?
- would like hpfilter to be more friendly to interactive logins
- rancid with zebra?  via vtysh?
- rancid for unix?
- would be nice if it were possible to add additional commands to be run
  per-platform as a user desires.  how could the user also provide a
  filtering routine?
- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin (or *login !!) into one.  possible?
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- flogin needs to be fixed for the userpasswd bug seen in jlogin 1.17, but
  this is clouded by the UI mess.
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
  Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- clogin/jlogin rsh is munged
- LG should sort routers
- LG {requested} command additions
	- show controllers T3 (data)
	- handle redback in the looking glass
	- show ip as-path-access-list
	- show access-list
	- show ip community-list
	- show ip route-map
