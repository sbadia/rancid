- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- better error loggin in the looking glass
- why do 'make distclean' & 'make dist' fail on fbsd 3.3?
- handle foundry and reback in the looking glass
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin into one.  possible?
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
- Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- check clogin.  does it handle multiple addrs for 1 fqdn correctly?

- the exec here needs a 'catch' in *login
    # This uses "id" which I think is portable.  At least it has existed
    # (without options) on all machines/OSes I've been on recently -
    # unlike whoami or id -nu.
    regexp {\(([^)]*)} [exec id] junk default_user 

	eg:
	couldn't fork child process: resource temporarily unavailable
	    while executing
	"exec id"

- make distclean does not remove
        util/Makefile
        util/config.log
        util/config.status
        util/rtrfilter
- do-diffs (or something in the proc path) should make sure that all
  the CVS'd files are up to date with respect to the repository.
