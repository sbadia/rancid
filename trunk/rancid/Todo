- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- handle reback in the looking glass
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin (or *login !!) into one.  possible?
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- flogin needs to be fixed for the userpasswd bug seen in jlogin 1.17, but
  this is clouded by the UI mess.
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
  Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
