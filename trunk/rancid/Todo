- extreme collections loses when the config on the switch is in an unsaved
  state, probably due to the prompt changing or rather the regex clogin
  formulates for the prompt.
- cat4 support?
- would be nice if it were possible to add additional commands to be run
  per-platform as a user desires.  how could the user also provide a
  filtering routine?
- need par.1 manpage
- need to make sure the following patch was applied to the lookingglass
	All routers not listed as 'up' in router.db are considered down.
	This allows values other than down to mean 'not up'.  for use
	by util/downreport.
- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- handle redback in the looking glass
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin (or *login !!) into one.  possible?
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- flogin needs to be fixed for the userpasswd bug seen in jlogin 1.17, but
  this is clouded by the UI mess.
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
  Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- clogin/jlogin rsh is munged
- LG additions
	- show controllers T3 (data)
