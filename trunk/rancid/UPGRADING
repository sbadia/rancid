Rancid 2.3 introduces a new directory layout.  It has been changed to more
closely follow the standard path hierarchy, which is defined by the FHS
standard and autoconf, and/or make these locations more easily configurable
within rancid.

The obvious advantage of this is making rancid more easily packagable; ie:
NetBSD pkgsrc, FreeBSD port, Linux RPM, etc.

Make sure your rancid repository is quiet before upgrading; disable rancid
cron jobs, wait for running jobs to complete, etc.

Autoconf defines the following (see configure --help):
 Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [/usr/local/rancid]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                          [PREFIX]

 Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR          user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR         system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR      program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]
  --datadir=DIR         read-only architecture-independent data [PREFIX/share]
  --sysconfdir=DIR      read-only single-machine data [PREFIX/etc]
  --localstatedir=DIR   modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]
  --mandir=DIR          man documentation [PREFIX/man]

 Also defined, though not mentioned above, is:
  pkgdatadir		same as datadir, but datadir/rancid

File and directory movement:
  bin/env		the rancid configuration file has moved to
			sysconfdir/rancid.conf
  util/lg/lg.conf	the looking glass configuration has move to
			sysconfdir/lg.conf
  util/lg/lg.cgi
  util/lg/lgform.cgi	the looking glass CGI scripts have moved to bindir
  util/lg/*		the remainder of looking glass html, README, etc
			files have moved to pkgdatadir
  util/*		misc examples, scripts, etc have moved to pkgdatadir
  cloginrc.sample	moved to pkgdatadir

For those upgrading, there is one basic choice to make; to move your CVS
repository and logs or not.  Prior to rancid 2.3, these were placed in
<PREFIX>.  They are now in "localstatedir".

To maintain the same location as was used prior to rancid 2.3, provide
the --localstatedir option to configure.  eg:

	./configure --localstatedir=/usr/local/rancid

To move them elsewhere, accept the default (eg: /usr/local/rancid/var) or
specify your own and move the existing directories.  eg:

	./configure --localstatedir=/var/rancid
	mv /usr/local/rancid/logs /var/rancid
	mv /usr/local/rancid/CVS /var/rancid
	mv /usr/local/rancid/<GROUPS> /var/rancid

where <GROUPS> is each group in rancid.conf's (previously bin/env)
LIST_OF_GROUPS variable.

Note that not all operating systems have a mv command that will move
directories across file systems.
