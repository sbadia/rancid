	if environment variable NOCOMMSTR is set.

	merge tkennedy@verio.net's support for cisco 2900xl into rancid

	Ignore "fan spinning at" noise on junipers.

1.5
	sync command-line option between clogin / jlogin.  jlogin modified:
		-x passphrase   ->      -r passphrase

	to adjust expected cisco router prompts in clogin.

	see README for info on web interface to rancid CVS repository.

	Try to detect hung rancid jobs & send email.

	Add (partial) support for the cat5s.  Still need more work
	on the show output, but it does grab the config.

	Skip the juniper's kernel version, memory, and fsck output
	of "show system boot-messages" - fsck output changes every
	time you boot and the version & memory is better found
	elsewhere.

	Delete the cisco ospf authentication and ftp passwords.

	Get both (juniper) show chassis ssb and scb but only process
	them once.

	Get info from show diag for 2600s as well.

	Catch juniper "command is not valid on the olive" errors.

	Catch juniper config mismatch between versions of JUNOS.

	Catch close on EOF in clogin/jlogin/flogin.

	Don't expand RCS keywords in config files.

	Catch the case were rancid gets and error and leaves an
	empty new config file.

	Make the time to elapse before complaining about unreachable
	routers be configurable instead of fixed at 24 hrs.  The
	default is now 4 hours.

	Add -x passphrase to jlogin.

	You can now set a ssh identity file in .cloginrc for use
	with jlogin.

	Handle more errors in jrancid.  Also handle changes for
	JUNOS 4.0 and collect "show system boot-messages" output.

	rancid now recognizes cisco 12016s and more types of 7200s.
	It also looks for WARNING messages in show version.
	And sort ip explicit-paths.

1.4
	sort cisco route-maps

	added (crude) foundry switch bits

	reworked code to reduce jumps. improvement in speed/cpu util.

	add more info/clarification to README for install.

1.2
	add more info/clarification to README for install.

	rename .cloginrc.sample -> cloginrc.sample.

	clogin patch (courtesy stephen stuart); does two things:

	- adds a "-x" switch that takes lines from a file and does the same
	thing as if you'd specified ;-separated commands with -c (newline
	separates commands)

	- does a subst on commands in run_commands so that expansion of
	escapes is performed; e.g. you can say "copy rcp://blah slot0:\r" to
	answer the question that comes after the copy command.
