	group's collection.

	configure now has a --enable-mail-plus option to have rancid
	send mail to rancid+$GROUP instead of to rancd-$GROUP.

	tested.

	You can now set a ssh identity file in .cloginrc for use
	with jlogin.

	Handle more errors in jrancid.  Also handle changes for
	JUNOS 4.0 and collect "show system boot-messages" output.

	rancid now recognizes cisco 12016s and more types of 7200s.
	It also looks for WARNING messages in show version.

	rename .cloginrc.sample -> cloginrc.sample.

	clogin patch (courtesy stephen stuart); does two things:

	- adds a "-x" switch that takes lines from a file and does the same
	thing as if you'd specified ;-separated commands with -c (newline
	separates commands)

	- does a subst on commands in run_commands so that expansion of
	escapes is performed; e.g. you can say "copy rcp://blah slot0:\r" to
	answer the question that comes after the copy command.
