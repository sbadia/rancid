Short list of things the next release is holding on....so I do not loose
track.

- extreme login stuff that asp mentioned in email
- extreme login shite from stephen stuart
- autoenable login to cats does not work
- cisco content engine change questions for Rob Evans
- awaiting comment on clogin cat1900 menu shite, enter K to get cli
- cloginrc sshcmd thing
- caught this in a log file...after _I_ stupidly ran do-diffs as root.
  can we deal with this with input redirection, whatevercmd < /dev/null ?

	override rw-r-----  root/wheel for routers.all? 

- god damn foundry....flogin does recognize when enable pwd is wrong, like:
	telnet@s01.enwdco01.us.ra>enable
	User Name:eng
	Password:
	
	Error - Incorrect username or password.
	telnet@s01.enwdco01.us.ra>		<---- hang here
