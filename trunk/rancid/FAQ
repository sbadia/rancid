Frequently Asked Questions about rancid - last updated 20021223.

1) Platform specific

Q. I have a Cisco Catalyst 6500 series switch running the IOS (NOT catOS)
   software, is the router.db device type cisco or cat5?
A. A catalyst running IOS is type "cisco".  See the router.db(5) manual page.

Q. I have a Cisco ??? on which collection stopped working, but clogin works
   as expected.
A. Check if 'write term' produces output.  Some IOS combined with large
   configs and low free memory produce zero 'write term' output, esp. combined
   with a memory leak.  The device will have to be rebooted or upgraded.


2) CVS and filesystem permissions

Q. I am new to CVS, where can I find additional information?
A. The manual page for CVS is quite complete, but can be be overwhelming even
   for someone familiar with RCS.  There are some excellent resources on the
   web.  See http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html

Q. Errors are showing up in the logs like:
	cvs [diff aborted]: there is no version here; run 'cvs checkout' first
A. The directory was not imported into CVS properly or was not properly checked
   out afterward, so CVS control files or directories do not exist.  create_cvs
   should always be used to create the directories and perform the CVS work.
   If it is just the directories that have been created manually, save a copy of
   the router.db file, then remove the group's directory, use create_cvs, and
   replace the router.db file.  If the CVS import was also performed manually,
   cd to <BASEDIR> and use 'cvs co <rancid group>' to create all the CVS
   control bits.

Q. I keep receiving the same diff for a (or set of) devices, but I know the
   data is not changing repeatedly.  Why?
A. This is probably a CVS or filesystem permissions problem.  Check the log
   file from the last run for that group for clues first; it may provide the
   exact cause.

   Note: It is very important the following be done as the user who normally
         runs the rancid collection from cron.

   Check the cvs status of the device's file.  example:

   guelah [2704] cvs status rtr.shrubbery.net
   ===================================================================
   File: yogi.shrubbery.net        Status: Up-to-date

      Working revision:    1.197   Tue Jul 10 15:41:16 2001
      Repository revision: 1.197   /user/local/rancid/CVS/shrubbery/configs/rtr.shrubbery.net,v
      Sticky Tag:          (none)
      Sticky Date:         (none)
      Sticky Options:      (none)

   The Status: should be Up-to-date.  If the status is "Unknown", then somehow
   the file has been created without being cvs add'ed.  This should be
   corrected by removing that device's entry from the group's router.db file,
   run do-diffs, replace the entry in router.db, and run do-diffs again.

   If the Status is anything else, someone has most likely been touching the
   files manually.  Sane state can be achieved by removing the file and running
   cvs update <file> to get a fresh copy from the repository.

   Check the ownership and permissions of the file and directory and the
   directory and file in the cvs repository (/usr/local/rancid/CVS/).  They
   should be owned by the user who runs do-diffs from cron.  At the very least,
   the directory and files should be writable by the rancid user.  Group and
   world permissions will determined by the umask (default 027), which is set
   in /usr/local/rancid/bin/env.  Likely the easiest way to fix the ownership
   on the cvs repository is chown -R <rancid user> /usr/local/rancid/CVS

Q. I am renaming a device but would like the retain the history in CVS.  How
   is this done?
A. CVS does not provide a way (AFAIK) to rename files or to rename or delete
   directories.  The best way is to copy the CVS repository file manually
   like this (disclaimer: BE VERY CAREFUL mucking around with the repository):
	% su - rancid_user
	% cd /usr/local/rancid
	% echo "new_device_name:device_type:up" >> GROUP/router.db
	% cp -p CVS/GROUP/configs/old_device_name,v \
		CVS/GROUP/configs/new_device_name,v
   where GROUP is the name of the rancid group the device is a member of.
   Rancid will pick-up the new file with a CVS update the next time it runs.
   Once the renaming is complete, remove the old name from the router.db file
   and leave the CVS clean-up of the old filename to rancid.

   If one wanted to move a device to a different group and maintain the
   history, the same procedure would work.  Substituting the new group name
   appropriately.

Q. I am removing a group and would like to remove all traces of it from the
   rancid directory and the CVS repository.  How is this done?
A. As far as I know, CVS does not provide a way to remove directories.  First,
   remove the group from /usr/local/rancid/bin/env.  If rancid is running,
   wait for it to complete.  Then just recursively remove the directory.  For
   example, a group named "fubar":
	% su - rancid_user
	% cd /usr/local/rancid
	% rm -rf fubar CVS/fubar


3) General

Q. I have a (set of) device(s) on which collection fails.  How can I debug
   this?
A. Our usual diagnostic procedure for this is:
   - Make sure that the appropriate *login (example: clogin for cisco) works.
     This tests to make sure you don't have routing or firewall issues, DNS
     or hostname errors, that your .cloginrc is correct, your banner does
     not have some character that *login does not like, and that the *login
     script doesn't have a bug of some sort.  For example:

        clogin cisco_router

     Should login to cisco_router and produce a router prompt that you can
     use normally, as if clogin were not used (ie: telnet cisco_router).

   - See if commands can be executed on the router via clogin.  This will
     exercise the *login functionality needed for rancid.  For example:

        clogin -c 'show version; show diag' cisco_router

     Should login to cisco_router, run show version and show diag, then
     disconnect and exit.  The output will be displayed on your terminal.

   - Then see if the correct rancid commands work against the router.  For
     example:

        rancid cisco_router

     Should produce a cisco_router.new file (cooked to a golden rancid-style
     colour) in the current directory.  If it does not, try again with the
     -d option, so that the cisco_router.new file will not be removed if
     an error is detected.  Note: if you have NOPIPE set in your environment,
     a cisco_router.raw file will be produced that is the raw output of the
     dialogue with the device.

   If all of these work, make sure that the device's entry in the group's
   router.db file is correct and check the group's last log file for errors.

Q. Are there any characters in the banner that rancid has problems with OR
   I changed the device's command prompt?
A. The trickiest part about clogin (et al) is recognizing the prompt
   correctly.  clogin looks for '>' and '#' to figure out if it is logged
   in or in enable mode.  So if you have a '>' or '#' in your login banner
   (other other motd), then clogin gets all confused and will not be
   able to log in correctly, and thus rancid will fail.

   Don't use '>' or '#' in your prompt or in your banner or other motd.

Q. I would like to collect device configurations every hour, but only receive
   diffs every Nth collection or every N hours.  Is this possible?
A. Certainly, but rancid does not provide such a mechanism natively.  Two
   approaches are recommended:

	1) Using your preferred mail-list software, add a list with a digest
	   and configure your MTA (example: sendmail) to send diffs to the
	   list.  Configure the mail-list software to force the digest at the
	   interval desired.  This allows folks to choose which type they
	   prefer, after each collection or every N hours.

	   This method also provides easy methods to archive the diff mail and
	   retrieve previous diffs.

	2) Write a script to send diffs, which saves the time it last ran
	   and passes this to the -D option of CVS.

   Obviously, the first option is the cleanest and most featureful, which is
   why the script mention in the second option is not provided.
