.SH NAME
router.db \- rancid group configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B router.db
contains information for devices which are members of a rancid group.
.IR control_rancid (1)
reads this file to compile a list of devices which it should collect.
.\"
.SH SYNTAX
One device is listed per-line, where the syntax is:
.PP
.in +1i
.nf
<device_name>:<device_type>:<state>[:][comments]
.fi
.in -1i
.PP
For example:
.in +1i
.nf
scooby.shrubbery.net:cisco:up
.fi
.in -1i
.PP
.\"
The fields are as follows:
.TP
.B <device_name>
The name of the device, which must resolve via
.I gethostbyname\c
, used as the argument to
.IR telnet (1),
.IR rsh (1),
or
.IR ssh (1),
to connect to the device.  Once converted to lower-case, this
also becomes the name of the file used to store the configuration under
\fI$BASEDIR/<group>/configs\fR.
.sp
Experience has shown that using the device's FQDN (Fully Qualified
Domain Name) works best, as in the example above.
.\"

.B <device_type>

.RS 8n

.RE
.\"
.TP
.B <state>
The state is either "up", or some other arbitrary value, e.g. "down".
If the device is not marked "up" the device's configuration will not be
collected.
It is highly recommended that comments are made for 
any router not listed as up, so as to indicate the
reason a router is not to be polled, e.g.:
.TP
.PP
dial1.paris:cisco:up:
core1.paris:cisco:down:in testing until 5/5/2001.
core2.paris:cisco:ticketed:Ticket 6054234, 5/3/2001
border1.paris:juniper:up:
.TP
.PP
Please see the script "downreport" in util/ for a
daily report of routers in router.db that aren't
marked "up".
.PP
.TP
.B [comments]
.TP
.PP
Freeform string to describe the current state of
the router.
.PP
A ``#'' at the begining of a line is a comment; the entire line is
ignored.
.PP
If you delete a device from the 
.B router.db
file, then
.B rancid
will clean up by removing the device's config file from
\fI$BASEDIR/<group>/configs\fR.
The
.IR cvs (1)
information for the device will be moved to 
.IR cvs (1)'s
Attic directory (using
.IR "cvs delete").
.PP
.SH FILES
.ta \w'xBASEDIR/<group>/router.db  'u
.TP
.B $BASEDIR/<group>/router.db
Configuration file described here, where <group> is a device group name
defined in the variable
.I LIST_OF_GROUPS
within \fI$BASEDIR/bin/env\fR.
