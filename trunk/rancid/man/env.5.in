.SH NAME
env \- rancid environment configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B env
contains environment configuration information for
.BR do-diffs (1)
and
.BR rancid (1)
including shell PATH, list of rancid groups, etc. and is read by
.BR do-diffs (1)
at run-time.
.PP
The syntax of
.B env
is that of
.IR sh (1).
.B env
is used to set environment variables used by other rancid scripts to
effect their run-time behavior or to enable them to find their resources.
.PP
.SH VARIABLES
The following variables are used (alphabetically):
.PP
.Bl -tag -width flag
.\"
.TP
.B BASEDIR
BASEDIR is the top-level directory where rancid is installed.  Its value
is set by configure and should be modified if rancid is moved to a new
location in the file system without re-installing from the distribution.
.sp
Default: @prefix@
.\"
.TP
.B CVSROOT
.IR cvs (1)
and
.IR create_cvs (1)
use this environment variable to locate the CVS repository.  It should
not be necessary to alter CVSROOT.
.sp
Default: $BASEDIR/CVS
.\"
.TP
.B FILTER_PWDS
Determines which passwords will be filtered from configs.  The value may be
"NO", "YES", or "ALL" to filter none of the passwords, only those which are
reversable or plain-text, or all (plus ssh keys, etc), respectively.
.sp
Default: YES
.sp
Note: a value of "NO" could be a security issue since diffs are sent via
e-mail.  A value of "ALL" is encouraged.
.sp
Note:
.B FILTER_PWDS
does not affect the handling of SNMP community strings.  see
.B NOCOMMSTR
below.
.sp
Note: passwords whose value cycles and would produce erroneous diffs
are always filtered (eg: Alteon passwords).
.\"
.TP
.B LIST_OF_GROUPS
Defines a list of group names of routers separated by white-space.  These
names become the directory names in $BASEDIR which contain the data
for that set of devices.
.BR do-diffs (1)
also uses this variable to determine which device groups it should collect.
Choose these names to be descriptive of the set of devices and do not use
spaces, unprintable characters, etc.
.sp
Example: LIST_OF_GROUPS="UofO USFS"
.sp
Two groups are defined; UofO (University of Oregon) and USFS (US Forest
Service).  Each will have a directory created (see
.IR create_cvs (1))
$BASEDIR/UofO and $BASEDIR/USFS respectively, which will contain their data.
.sp
Each group must also have aliases for the administrative and diff recipients
set-up in
.IR /etc/aliases .
For example:
.sp
.in +1i
.nf
@MAILPLUS@uofo:            frank
@MAILPLUS@admin-uofo:      joe,bob
@MAILPLUS@usfs:            frank
@MAILPLUS@admin-usfs:      joe,bob
.fi
.sp
.in -1i
.\"
.TP
.B NOCOMMSTR
If set,
.IR rancid (1)
will filter SNMP community strings from configs.  Otherwise, they will
be retained and may appear in clear-text in e-mail diffs.  By default,
this is not set.
.\"
.TP
.B NOPIPE
If set,
.IR rancid (1)
will use temporary files to save the output from the router and then read
these to build the file which will be saved in CVS.  Otherwise, an IPC
pipe will be used.  We have found that the buffering mechanisms used in
perl and expect are heinous.  Using temporary files may result in a noticeable
improvement in speed.  By default, this is not set.
.\"
.TP
.B OLDTIME
Specified as a number of hours, OLDTIME defines how many hours should pass
since a successful collection of a device's configuration and when
.IR control_rancid (1)
should start complaining about failures.  The value should be greater than
the number of hours between do-diffs cron runs.
.sp
Default: 4
.\"
.TP
.B PAR_COUNT
Defines the number of rancid processes that
.IR par (1)
will start simultaneously as
.IR control_rancid (1)
attempts to perform collections.  Raising this value will decrease the amount
of time necessary for a complete collection of a (or all) rancid groups at the
expense of system load.  The default is relatively cautious.  If collections
are not completing quickly enough for users, use trial and error of speed
versus system load to find a suitable value.
.sp
Default: 5
.\"
.TP
.B PATH
Is a colon separate list of directory pathnames in the the file system
where rancid's
.IR sh (1)
and
.IR perl (1)
scripts should look for the programs that it needs, such as
.IR telnet (1).
Its value is set by configure.  Should it be necessary to modify PATH,
note that it must include $BASEDIR/bin (see above).
.\"
.TP
.B TERM
Some Unix utilities require TERM, the terminal type, to be set to a sane
value.  The default should suffice.
.sp
Default: network
.\"
.TP
.B TMPDIR
Some Unix utilities recognize TMPDIR as a directory where temporary files
can be stored.  In some cases, rancid utilizes this directory for lock
files and other temporary files.
.sp
Default: /tmp
.\"
.PP
Each of these are simply environment variables.  In order for them to be
present in the environment of child processes, each must be exported.  See
.IR sh (1)
for more information on the built-in command export.
.SH ERRORS
.B env
is interpreted directly by 
.IR sh (1),
so its syntax follows that of the bourne shell.  Errors
may produce quite unexpected results.
.SH FILES
