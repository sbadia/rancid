- reversables that need to be filtered, from asp

  These were taken from .cli files; I don't remember what version
  this was, but 2.0 something from about Oct 26 (maybe 2.0.0.3-A).

  router isis xx
   authentication-key pp level-.
          - pp is reversible

  interface xx
   isis authentication-key pp [level-.]
        - pp is reversible

  ip ospf message-digest-key <keyid> md5 <enctype> <key>
        - key is ?
        - enctype is 0|7
	it has to be reversible, so it can be used to encrypt pkts

  ip vrrp authentication simple key <key1>
        key1 is reversible

  interface xx
   router vrrp
    authentication simple key <key1>
        key1 is reversible

- lots of GC'ing to be done
